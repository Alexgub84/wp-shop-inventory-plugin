# Workspace Scope

This is the WooCommerce Shop Inventory Plugin repo (wp-shop-inventory-plugin).
Only modify files inside this repo. Never modify files in other repos.

# How to Start Every Task

Before writing any code, FIRST use the Read tool on ALL of these files:

1. docs/full-project-spec.md (product requirements, entities, API endpoints, implementation status)
2. docs/architecture.md (system architecture, decisions, security checklist)
3. docs/workflow-rules.md (git workflow, planning, code standards, security, testing rules)
4. docs/dev-lessons.md (past bugs - check before debugging)

Read the docs FIRST, then explore the specific files in this repo that are relevant to the task.
Do NOT scan the entire codebase upfront - only look at files directly related to the work.

# Updating Documentation

When you fix a bug, learn something new, or change workflow:
- Update docs/dev-lessons.md with the lesson
- If the fix implies a new rule, propose adding it to docs/workflow-rules.md
- If specs changed (features done, new endpoints), update docs/full-project-spec.md
- If architecture changed, update docs/architecture.md
- If testing patterns changed, update docs/testing-strategy.md

# Quick Reference

All detailed rules live in the docs/ folder:

- **docs/full-project-spec.md** — complete product spec, entities, API endpoints, file structure, stack
- **docs/mvp-spec.md** — MVP scope, simplified decisions, implementation checklist
- **docs/architecture.md** — system architecture, component responsibilities, message flows, all 6 decisions, security checklist
- **docs/workflow-rules.md** — issue-driven dev, git workflow, commit conventions, PHP/WordPress coding standards, security rules, finalization checklist
- **docs/testing-strategy.md** — three-tier testing (unit, integration, E2E), patterns, mock factories, test commands
- **docs/dev-lessons.md** — bug/lesson log, updated after every fix
